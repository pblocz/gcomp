# Computational geometry

Assignments for the subject *Computational Geometry* during the course
2014/2015 in the UCM.

It consists on some common problems solved using python with libraries
such as numpy, scipy, matplotlib... For most of the assignments
efficiency was taken into account as a key factor.


# Assignments


1. **Signature check**: check whether two parametrized curves are the
   same or not using its signature.

2. **Geodesics**: plot geodesics for 3D surfaces given by its
   parametrization or by their *first fundamental form*.

3. **Bezier curves**: plot bezier curves from a control polygon using
   different algorithms.

4. **Bezier intersection**: use bezier division algorithm to plot
   curves and find intersection points.

5. **Interpolation**: use different methods to find exact and
   approximate interpolation curves.

6. **Spline curves**: compute spline curve values from control points,
   knots and their multiplicities.

7. **Convex hull**: compute 2D convex hull using different O(n log(n)) algorithms.
